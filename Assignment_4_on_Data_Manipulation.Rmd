 #Interpretation 
#Africa: GDP is right-skewed(few rich countries, many poor)
#Europe: More symmetric; most countries moderately wealthy.
#Asia: Bimodal (very rich and very poor countries)
#Others: Smaller number of countries,higher variance

      # While the gap has been narrowing in recent years due to India's faster economic growth compared to some other parts of the world, India's Per Capita income still lags behind the global mean, indicating room for further economic development and income growth relative to global standards.
